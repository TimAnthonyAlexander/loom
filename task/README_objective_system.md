# Objective Immutability System

## Problem Solved

The LOOM system had a critical issue where the LLM would:
1. Set a simple objective (e.g., "Read README file")
2. Complete the simple task
3. **Incorrectly expand the objective** (e.g., "Analyze entire project architecture")
4. Continue working on the expanded scope instead of finishing

This caused scope creep and prevented proper completion detection.

## Solution Overview

The **Objective Immutability System** ensures the LLM stays focused on its original objective until completion, while still allowing natural exploration within that scope.

### Key Components

1. **Enhanced System Prompt** (`llm/prompt.go`)
   - Explicit objective immutability rules
   - Clear examples of correct vs incorrect patterns
   - Focused exploration guidance

2. **Objective Tracking** (`task/completion_detector.go`)
   - Tracks original objective as immutable
   - Detects when LLM tries to change objectives
   - Validates objective consistency across responses

3. **Manager Integration** (`task/manager.go`)
   - Intercepts LLM responses before task execution
   - Provides warnings when objectives change
   - Redirects LLM back to original objective

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Objective Setting
```go
// User asks: "Read the README file"
// LLM sets: "OBJECTIVE: Read and understand the README file"
// System tracks this as the immutable objective
```

### 2. Objective Validation
```go
// Every LLM response is checked for objective changes
objectiveValidation := m.completionDetector.ValidateObjectiveConsistency(llmResponse)

if !objectiveValidation.IsValid {
    // System redirects LLM back to original objective
    warningMessage := m.completionDetector.FormatObjectiveWarning(objectiveValidation)
    // Add correction message to chat
}
```

### 3. Exploration Within Scope
The LLM can still explore naturally, but within objective bounds:

**‚úÖ ALLOWED:**
```
OBJECTIVE: Read and understand the README file
üîß READ README.md
Current focus: Understanding dependencies section  
üîß READ package.json
Current focus: Checking build configuration
üîß READ webpack.config.js
OBJECTIVE_COMPLETE: Full analysis of README and related files
```

**‚ùå BLOCKED:**
```
OBJECTIVE: Read and understand the README file
üîß READ README.md
OBJECTIVE: Analyze entire project architecture  ‚Üê BLOCKED!
```

## Implementation Details

### Objective Similarity Detection
The system uses semantic similarity to allow minor rewording while blocking scope changes:

```go
func (cd *CompletionDetector) isObjectiveEquivalent(original, new string) bool {
    similarity := cd.calculateObjectiveSimilarity(
        cd.normalizeObjective(original), 
        cd.normalizeObjective(new)
    )
    return similarity >= 0.8 // 80% similarity threshold
}
```

### Warning System
When objective changes are detected, the system provides clear guidance:

```
üö® OBJECTIVE CHANGE DETECTED

‚ùå You changed your objective mid-stream:
   Original: "Read and understand the README file"
   New:      "Analyze entire project architecture"

üéØ STAY FOCUSED: Complete your original objective first!

‚úÖ Correct approach:
   1. Keep working on: "Read and understand the README file"
   2. Signal completion with: OBJECTIVE_COMPLETE: [your analysis]
   3. ONLY THEN set new objectives if needed
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration
```go
// Initialize manager with objective tracking
manager := NewManager(executor, llmAdapter, chatSession)

// Handle LLM responses with objective validation
execution, err := manager.HandleLLMResponse(llmResponse, eventChan)
```

### Reset for New Conversations
```go
// Reset objective tracking for new user conversations
manager.ResetObjectiveTracking()
```

### Check Objective Status
```go
objective, isSet, changeCount := manager.GetObjectiveStatus()
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Scope Creep**: LLM stays focused on original task
2. **Enables Completion Detection**: Clear boundaries for when work is done
3. **Maintains Natural Exploration**: LLM can still investigate thoroughly within scope
4. **Provides Clear Feedback**: System guides LLM back when it strays
5. **Reduces Endless Loops**: Work has clear completion criteria

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive validation:

- Objective similarity detection (80% threshold)
- Normalization for minor rewording
- Warning message generation
- Integration with existing task execution

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progressive Objectives**: Allow new objectives after completion
2. **User Override**: Let users approve objective changes
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Suggest when broader exploration might be beneficial
4. **Metrics**: Track objective focus vs completion rates
